# Social Network For Pets React App

In this project, I've built a simple social network for pets.

You’ll be able to view a pet’s profile (which contains their name, bio, and friend list) and navigate to other profiles. There will also be a profile directory where you can see all of the profiles.

I’ve set up three profiles: one for a cat, one for a dog, and one for a komodo dragon.
